    <h1>Self Driving Car Simulation</h1>
    <div>
      The project is an educational tool for AI, neural networks, and autonomous vehicles. It lets users observe
      self-driving cars in a simulated environment, exploring AI dynamics. It's interactive, fostering experimentation
      with AI algorithms and simulations.

    <h2>Instructions for usage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Restart Button: </b>Clicking this button will refresh the page, resetting the simulation to its initial
        state.
        This is useful if you want to start over or if the simulation needs to be reset for any reason.</li>
      <li><b>Save Button:</b> Use the Save button to store the neural network configuration of the best-performing AI
        model in
        localStorage. This allows you to preserve the model's performance even after closing the page or refreshing it.
      </li>
      <li><b>Delete Button:</b> Clicking the Delete button removes the saved neural network configuration from
        localStorage.
        This is helpful if you want to clear the saved model's data or if you want to start fresh without any saved
        configurations.</li>
    </ul><br />
    <div>By following these instructions and utilizing the provided buttons, users can interact with the car simulation
      and control its behavior according to their preferences.</div>
    <h2>Neural Network Visualization:</h2>
    <div>The neural network visualization provides a graphical representation of the connections within the neural
      network of the current best car. This visualization offers insight into how information flows through the network
      and how different neurons are interconnected.</div>
