# Self Driving car in Vanilla JS

It is completely written in vanilla javascript with no libraries used, self-driving features yet to be added but a basic setup is ready.

Check it out [here](https://self-driving-car.shashankbhosagi.com/)

## Use Arrow keys to control the car.
- `Arrow up` : move forward
- `Arrow down` : move backward
- `Arrow left` : move left
- `Arrow right` : move right

  
#### Note : Don't hit the road borders or cars.. If you happen to hit them, my collision detection system will stop your car, now to play you have to refresh the page and start over again.

### Further pending work
- Adding neural networks to the blue car with controls.
- Adding more traffic
- Adding two modes to it
    - Game mode : In which visitors will be able to control the blue car
    - Automated mode : In which the trained car will drive on its own

## Enjoy XD
